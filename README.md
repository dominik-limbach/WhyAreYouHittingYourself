# WhyAreYouHittingYourself
A neat little application for the modern sadistic investor. 

Ever since the invention of Bitcoin and its meteoric rise to a one trillion dollar asset class 
there have been people eating their hearts out because they have missed the boat on the investment opportunity of a lifetime.

This application, like many other of its kind, channels your deepest and darkest FOMO by presenting you with cold hard numbers that constitute the magnitude of your mistake.
But, rather than taking a specific date, of which you think was "that" day you could have given in, this application will search your
amazon order history and tell you exactly how much your money, you showerd the great Bezos with all this years, 
could have been worth if you would have invested it into bitcoin instead.
